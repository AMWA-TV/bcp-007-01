This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Enables Registration, Discovery, and Connection Management of NDI endpoints using the AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 NMOS Specifications.
- Specifies the interaction of NMOS-enabled NDI nodes and non-NMOS NDI nodes.

### Why does it matter?

- It allows NDI endpoints and gateways to integrate in an NMOS-managed control environment.

### How does it work?

- It specifies how NDI senders and receivers are defined within the scope of IS-04 and IS-05
- It specifies how NDI receivers can be connected to NMOS NDI senders or native NDI senders
- It defines the representation of muxed NDI flows of video, audio and metadata
