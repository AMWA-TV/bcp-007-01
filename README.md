<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?
 - Enables Registration, Discovery, and Connection Management of NDI Endpoints using the AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 NMOS Specifications.
 - Specifies the interaction of NMOS-enabled NDI nodes and non-NMOS NDI nodes.

### Why does it matter?
- It allows NDI endpoints and gateways to integrate in an NMOS-managed control environment.

### How does it work?
- It specifies how NDI senders and receivers are defined within the scope of IS-04 and IS-05.
- It specifies how connections can be made to non-NMOS NDI senders.
- It defines the representation of muxed NDI flows of video, audio and metadata.
